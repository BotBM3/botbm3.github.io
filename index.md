# Question

**What do we want from our model-to-brain mapping metrics and how do we get it?**

# Abstract

Over the last decade, cognitive neuroscience has undergone something of a paradigm shift. Where once we suffered a dearth of task-performant computational models that could reasonably predict (beyond early perceptual areas) how the biological brain responds to sensory stimuli, weâ€™re now inundated with them. While thrilling, this profusion of riches has resurfaced longstanding, fundamental -- even existential -- questions about what we stand to learn from model-to-brain mappings, and how much we may or may not have learned already. In this Community Event, incorporating elements from both Generative Adversarial Collaborations (GACs) and Keynotes and Tutorials (K&Ts), we bring together a diverse team of researchers unified by 3 common goals: first, to extensively articulate our common and contrasting beliefs about we stand to gain from the use of neural models in cognitive neuroscience; second, to outline what metrics of progress we believe are theoretically best-suited for measuring those gains; and finally, to use a massive-scale, data-driven empirical analysis to bridge the gap what we believe and what we observe.
